## Setup

Run `docker compose up` to create and start the backend's container.

I decided to use Docker as it should ensure that, when you run this backend
service, no issue arises.

## Use the app

1. Go into the `frontend` folder from the terminal
2. Run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start serving the app locally
4. Go to `localhost:8000` from your browser
